# Instagram-Brave-Bot
This is a Instagram unfollow/follow bot which uses Selenium to automate its functions, with the Brave Browser.

# Instructions
1. The script will first need dependencies.
So first, open up your command prompt and type:
- pip install browser
- pip install selenium
- pip install time
- pip install password

2. After that, you will have to change the driver path with your own.
To install the driver, go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and pick the version that matches your Brave Browser.  You will also have to change the Brave path, you can install Brave here: https://brave.com/

3. Change the send keys input to your email and password, this is safe as long as you don't open the file infront of people or send it to your friends.

4. At the bottom, uncomment either Follow() or Unfollow() depending on what you want to use.

5. Run the script as brave.py and Selenium should open the browser for you.
